# decentralized_Storage

Minimalistic simulation of blockchain using Node.js to understand the working of a decentralized file system.

The application replicates

- Block strucuture

- Block creation

- File Hashing

- Proof of Work consensus


But the implementation does not cover the P2P implementation.

The application merely handles the storage of file hashes which could be generated by storing in IPFS network or 
an off chain file system.
